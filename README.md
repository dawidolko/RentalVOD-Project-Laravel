## 2. Tools and Technologies

### Laravel Framework

Laravel is a popular web application framework based on PHP, created by Taylor Otwell. It is an advanced tool that enables rapid and efficient development of scalable web applications using modern programming techniques and design patterns, which facilitates writing clean and maintainable code.

In this project, we use Laravel version 11.x, which offers numerous functionalities and improvements over previous versions. Laravel is distributed under the MIT license, allowing free use, modification, and distribution. The official Laravel documentation is available on the [Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs) website.

### Database

The application uses the MySQL database engine. MySQL is open-source software available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). You can download the latest version of MySQL from the [MySQL Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) page.

#### Database Server Connection Configuration

To configure the connection to the MySQL server, edit the `config/database.php` configuration file. In this file, the `connections` section allows you to define connection settings for different environments (e.g., development, production).

**Example MySQL connection configuration:**

```php
'connections' => [
    'mysql' => [
        'driver' => 'mysql',
        'host' => env('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
        'port' => env('DB_PORT', '3306'),
        'database' => env('DB_DATABASE', 'rentalVOD'),
        'username' => env('DB_USERNAME', 'your_username'),
        'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_password'),
        'charset' => 'utf8mb4',
        'collation' => 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci',
        'prefix' => '',
        'strict' => true,
        'engine' => null,
    ],
],
```

Set the appropriate values for the `host`, `port`, `database`, `username`, and `password` parameters according to your MySQL server configuration.

### Frontend

The application uses Blade as its templating engine for generating HTML views. Blade is easy to use yet powerful, allowing full use of PHP without the complications of other templating engines. Combined with CSS and JavaScript, it provides a dynamic and responsive user interface.

### Middleware

In Laravel, middleware is used to perform intermediary tasks during the processing of HTTP requests. In this project, middleware is used to check user permissionsâ€”for example, verifying if the user is an administrator.

### Controllers

Controllers in Laravel organize the application logic and handle HTTP requests. For example, an `AdminController` might manage users and movies.

### Models

Models in Laravel are responsible for database interactions. A sample `Movie` model might look like this:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Movie extends Model
{
    // Model code here
}
```

### Services

The application uses services that contain business logic, such as calculating dynamic movie prices.

### Data Validation

Laravel offers an easy way to validate data using form requests. For example, validation for adding a new movie might be written as:

```php
public function rules()
{
    return [
        'title' => 'required|string|max:255',
        'description' => 'required|string',
        // additional rules...
    ];
}
```

### Data Seeding

To load sample data into the database, seeders are used. A sample seeder might be:

```php
public function run()
{
    \App\Models\Movie::factory(50)->create();
}
```

Each of the above technical elements and tools is carefully integrated into the application, ensuring smooth operation, ease of maintenance, and future scalability.

## 3. Database

### ERD Diagram

### Description of the Database Solutions

**VOD MOVIE RENTAL:**  
The rental service for which the database is prepared is called RentalVOD.

**MOVIES:**  
The `movies` table stores all movies with key data about each. The `available` column indicates whether a movie is available for rental ("available") or currently rented ("unavailable"). The table also contains columns such as `title`, `description`, `director`, `release_year`, `price_day`, `img_path`, and `category_id`.

**USERS:**  
The `users` table stores information about users who have registered on the platform. It includes detailed user data such as `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `address`, `city`, `password`, `role_id` (for user permissions), `avatar`, and `loyalty_points`.

**LOANS:**  
The `loans` table records rental information including the start date (`start_date`), end date (`end_date`), rental status (`status`), and rental price (`price`). The `user_id` column stores the identifier of the user who made the rental.

**LOAN_MOVIE:**  
This pivot table connects the `loans` and `movies` tables, allowing the storage of which movies were rented in a particular transaction. It contains the `loan_id` and `movie_id` columns, which form the link between these tables.

**OPINIONS:**  
The `opinions` table stores user reviews of rented movies. It includes columns such as `content` (review text), `movie_id`, and `user_id` to link the review to the appropriate movie and user.

**CATEGORIES:**  
The `categories` table stores information about movie categories. The `species` column holds the category name.

**PREMIUM_MOVIES:**  
This table stores information about movies upgraded to premium quality by the user. It contains `user_id`, `movie_id`, and timestamps, showing when the premium upgrade was purchased.

**REFERRAL_CODES:**  
This table contains attributes like `user_id`, `code`, and timestamps. Each user has their own promotional code; when someone registers using that code, they receive 20 loyalty points on their account.

**LOYALTY_POINTS:**  
The `loyalty_points` table records the loyalty points for a user account, which can be exchanged for premium quality or used to purchase a movie. Attributes include `user_id`, `points`, and timestamps.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**  
This table represents movies recommended by friends. It includes attributes such as `user_id`, `friend_id`, `movie_id`, `status`, and timestamps.

**FRIENDSHIPS:**  
The `friendships` table stores `user_id`, `friend_id`, and `status`. It is used for managing friend connections.

### Migrations

Migrations in Laravel are used to manage the database structure. They allow you to create, modify, and delete tables and other database elements using PHP code, which simplifies managing the database during project development.

Each migration extends the `Migration` class and contains two methods: `up()` and `down()`. The `up()` method is executed when running the migration to create the database structure, while the `down()` method is executed when rolling back the migration to remove the previously created elements.

### Seeders

Seeders in Laravel are used to fill database tables with sample data. They are useful during testing and development as they allow quick loading of initial data. Seeders are particularly handy when sample data is needed for testing, system initialization, or demonstration purposes.

### Description of an Example Relationship in Models

Between the `movies` and `loans` tables, there exists a many-to-many relationship via the `loan_movie` pivot table. This relationship allows one movie to be included in many rentals, and one rental to contain many movies.

In the `Movie` model, a `loans()` method is defined to establish a many-to-many relationship with the `Loan` model using the `belongsToMany()` method. It specifies the pivot table `loan_movie` and sets the appropriate foreign key names.

Similarly, in the `Loan` model, a `movies()` method is defined to establish the relationship with the `Movie` model. This method also uses `belongsToMany()`, specifies the `loan_movie` pivot table, and sets the corresponding foreign key names.

By defining these relationships, you can easily access the related movies for a given rental via the `movies` attribute on a `Loan` object, and vice versa.
